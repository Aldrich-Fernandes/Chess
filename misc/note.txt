    --add vector to pos untill moveTo pos (return a test vector and a real vector)
        -- test vector: used to check if it is a valid move
        -- apply vector: applied to the pos to check if there will be a collision in the path
            -- allow if the final pos is a collison with the enemy (take piece)

--> Pawn Move:
    -- Killing
        
    -- Pawn Boost (start can move 2 places)
    -- Upgrading

--> Winning the match (just have the king die) ie kill the king for checkmate
